**3.1) Early Design Process and Ideation**

Our design process was intended to be as agile as possible. To help enable this, we split our development process into stages and tried to gain the insight of possible users at every stage of our process. 

At the first stage of our design process, each team member designed one or two different paper prototypes for our website. We intentionally made these designs very diverse in terms of how they implemented the website's concept. The benefits of this approach were

- Not limiting our thinking about the way to approach the project too early.
- Giving our early interviewees greater say over the direction of the project.
- Broadening our thinking so that we could trigger productive conversations about good features of all versions and cherry-pick popular features from different designs.

These early designs were split into three broad categories:

- 'Traditional' designs. Designs which mimicked very directly the interface of popular social media and [micro-blogging sites](https://github.com/A-Madeline-Bates/Group-Web-Project/blob/main/Design/prototypes/april/prototype-main.jpg).
- 'Dynamic interface' designs. These designs took a lot of features of popular social media sites and applied them to a more dynamic or novel interface. This set                 included a design which used [side-swipe navigation](https://github.com/A-Madeline-Bates/Group-Web-Project/blob/main/Design/prototypes/sam/paper_prototype1_home.png), a design which visually represented the [web of connections](https://github.com/A-Madeline-Bates/Group-Web-Project/blob/main/Design/prototypes/ercan/Picture%202.png) between user posts, and a design which placed [posts](https://github.com/A-Madeline-Bates/Group-Web-Project/blob/main/Design/prototypes/abby/Picture%204.png) in bubbles which grew in proportion to the post's popularity.
- 'Infinite' designs. This set included an interface which represented the timeline as a ['Star Wars'-esque scroll](https://github.com/A-Madeline-Bates/Group-Web-Project/blob/main/Design/prototypes/april/IMG_2985.jpg) of text which disappeared into the distance and a design which appeared to ['stack' posts](https://github.com/A-Madeline-Bates/Group-Web-Project/blob/main/Design/prototypes/tony/scroll.jpg) within a 3D space. These interfaces were intended to visually represent the 'endless' nature of social media content.

Each team member conducted small casual interviews with some possible users and then provided some 'pros' and 'cons' style [feedback](https://github.com/A-Madeline-Bates/Group-Web-Project/blob/main/Design/prototypes/Prototype%20voting%20board.pptx) on each design based on the responses from their interviews. From this feedback we determined that the interface of the 'infinite' designs was too confusing. Our core design goals were to create a recognisable social media-style interface and to create a platform to educate people about social media, and we ultimately concluded that 'dynamic interface' designs added a lot of complexity to the design without helping us to achieve these goals. Although users enjoyed the 'novel' nature of the dynamic designs, they were more confusing and less recognisable than the 'traditional' design. The fact that the 'traditional' design referenced the layout of websites like Twitter and Facebook in a straightforward way made it easier for anyone familiar with those sites to understand what our site was mimicking and how they should interact with it. It was therefore decided that the 'traditional' design was the best one to form our design basis moving forwards.
 
In our [first wireframe design](https://github.com/A-Madeline-Bates/Group-Web-Project/tree/main/Design/prototypes/first-wireframe), we took the basic layout of our 'Traditional' paper prototype design and tried to integrate a few popular features of the paper prototypes which we had shelved. This included the rounded shape of objects on the 'bubble' and 'web' designs, and concept of the infinitely scrolling timeline. We also created a draft version of the 'comment page' layout in which the comments appeared in 'bubbles' around the original post rather than underneath it as they would in a more traditional social media comment box layout.

After designing our wireframe, we casually interviewed a few individuals to gain some feedback about it. Insight from these interviews helped us to design a more formal anonymous questionnaire about the design. The questionnaire was split into three sections, each designed to address different questions that we had about how the project should develop. We first asked some questions about the demographic of our respondents and their experience with social media. This was to help us understand how users with different experiences responded to the site. We then showed the respondents our wireframe and asked them questions about the interface, including how confident they were that they would be able to use certain key features, and which page design they preferred in cases in which we had not settled on the final layout of a page. In the final section, we gave a full description of the website's concept and then asked the users to state the level of priority they would give to different features of the site to help us set priorities moving past our minimum viable product.

Feedback from this questionnaire reassured us that the fundamental layout of the page could remain as it was, because it was understandable by our core demographic.
At this stage we also completed User Journey Mapping to help us understand how different users might interact with our product. The user types we explored were based on some of the feedback we saw in our questionnaire. This process and the way it affected our thinking is detailed in the UX Approach section of the paper.

The feedback we received about the design and our thoughts following the User Journey Mapping were implemented in our [second prototype design](https://github.com/A-Madeline-Bates/Group-Web-Project/tree/main/Design/working%20wireframes/initial-version). These changes included:

- Removing unnecessary links in the left navigation bar to simplify and improve the typical interaction flow and encourage users to navigate to the 'About' page.
- Highlighting the page that users are on in the left navigation bar to make it more difficult to 'get lost' on the website.
- Adding icons to the left navigation bar.
- Integrating the 'traditional' comment interface into the design rather than the 'bubble' design.
- Adopting the 'differentiated user post' design for the fact box rather than the floating text box design.
- Adding a 'back' button to the comment page.

Prioritising having the bots responding to 'trends' and emulating the 'seamless' experience of real social media sites over other features.
This new wireframe formed the basis of our first stage of technical development. At the same time, we created two more wireframes which represented our realistic ‘stretch’ goals. The first of these [included comments](https://github.com/A-Madeline-Bates/Group-Web-Project/tree/main/Design/working%20wireframes/comments-version), and the second  [included comments and alerts](https://github.com/A-Madeline-Bates/Group-Web-Project/tree/main/Design/working%20wireframes/notifications-version). These were created so that if we moved into working on our stretch goals, we would not be slowed down by design ideation.
