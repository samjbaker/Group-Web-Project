# Background and Motivation

## 2.1) Identifying and defining our problem 
## 2.11) Problem definition
Based on research collected from user surveys and background literature, our team identified a problem around the effects of social media on young people (aged 18 - 25). (for more information on our ideation process, please refer to the [UX design section](UXDesign.md)). We found that social media is very prevalent in today’s society, and in the lives of young people. It can be a force for good, but also comes with negatives; such as social media addiction. Therefore, our problem definition was narrowed down to a ‘How Might We’ statement ([source](https://www.designkit.org/methods/3).
