# Background and Motivation

## 2.1) Identifying and defining our problem 
### 2.11) Problem definition
Based on research collected from user surveys and background literature, our team identified a problem around the effects of social media on young people (aged 18 - 25). (for more information on our ideation process, please refer to the [UX design section](UXDesign.md)). We found that social media is very prevalent in today’s society, and in the lives of young people. It can be a force for good, but also comes with negatives; such as social media addiction. Therefore, our problem definition was narrowed down to a ‘How Might We’ statement:

> ## “How might we create a solution that aims to educate young people on social media in an engaging and entertaining way?”

### 2.12) Scope of project

#### Technical Scope:
From a technical perspective, our **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** includes making use of the **MEAN** stack (refer to [System Implementation](SystemImplementation.md)) to send information from the database and on to the webpage, and vice-versa. Our MVP includes being able to store and receive sentences in the form of Fakebook posts, either from fake users (the bots) or created by the user. The user is able to interact with the site by creating their own Fakebook posts, and reading through a large array of posts. The posts from the bots must be created randomly and be semi-believably human.  
#### Design Scope:
Our design scope includes having 2 pages - a ‘Home’ page where the posts could be viewed, and an ‘About’ page detailing information about our project. On the ‘Home’ page, we would create individual names and profile pictures for the bots, and include different-coloured factboxes which are cited in between posts, to educate the user about social media. There are visual ‘likes’ and ‘comment’ buttons, but it was not within the scope of this project to implement functionality with these, so they are merely for aesthetic purposes. 

### 2.13) Challenges 
#### The challenges of our problem:
* **Reliability and breadth of information collected:** Due to factors such as time constraints and the pandemic, our team is limited in the amount and availability of information available to us. This is true in both our primary and secondary research - we do not have the time to collate academic information on the scale we would like, and do not have the time and resources available to conduct in-depth user studies. This is why we aim to target our research around small sample sizes. 
* **Large global issue, one small solution:** Our product aims to tackle an issue that is pervasive in all regions of the world, and affects people from a range of ages and nationalities. However, our scope aims to mitigate this - we have narrowed down our user group to young people, and part of our success criteria is defined in how these users of our webpage interact with it - as long as our users gain something positive from our webpage, our project can be deemed successful. 


## 2.2) Secondary Research

Social media use has exploded in the last few years, and is on course to continue this trajectory. The number of worldwide social media users in 2021 is 3.78 billion people (approximately half the world’s population), with it set to increase every year (see Figure 1.)
