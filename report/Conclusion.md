# 7) Conclusion

Looking back at our product development phase, on the whole we believe that our working practices were a success. There were, of course, some aspects that we could have improved upon. 

## 7.11) Adopting an agile framework 

We applied the agile framework effectively and tried to always bear in mind the four values [(source)](https://www.productboard.com/glossary/agile-values/). For instance, we prioritised getting user feedback & experience (individuals) over tools and processes. We also prioritised getting our software working first over comprehensive documentation of it. Additionally, we remained open to change of our design by trying not to have a too clearly pre-defined idea of it, allowing it to evolve in response to feedback.

One issue we faced during the development phase was burnout. This was due to a number of factors, not least the difficulty in communication due to COVID. However, we could have done more to mitigate these effects. For example, we could have had more numerous, smaller objectives, by adopting a hybrid working methodology which combined elements of waterfall and agile [(source)](https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/is-agile-waterfall-hybrid-right-for-your-team) and distributed these objectives more evenly in each sprint. 

## 7.12) Evaluation of our MVP 

We delivered all of the elements that were defined in our MVP. The design was developed effectively. The entire user interface prototype was implemented as accurately as possible via Angular. The required HTTP requests were correctly set up and tested via Postman. The database was successfully seeded upon building our docker container, and was able to deliver the correct information to the front end when required. We created our own random post generator, that we believe worked effectively. The details of each sprint were well documented and logged (please refer to [Sprints Management section](SprintsAndProjectManagements.md)).
