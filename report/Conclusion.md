Looking back at our product development phase, on the whole we believe that our working practices were a success. There were, of course, some aspects that we could have improved upon. 

##7.11) Adopting an agile framework 

We applied the agile framework effectively and tried to always bear in mind the four values [(source)](https://www.productboard.com/glossary/agile-values/). For instance, we prioritised getting user feedback & experience (individuals) over tools and processes. We also prioritised getting our software working first over comprehensive documentation of it. Additionally, we remained open to change of our design by trying not to have a too clearly pre-defined idea of it, allowing it to evolve in response to feedback.

One issue we faced during the development phase was burnout. This was due to a number of factors, not least the difficulty in communication due to COVID. However, we could have done more to mitigate these effects. For example, we could have had more numerous, smaller objectives, by adopting a hybrid working methodology which combined elements of waterfall and agile [(source)](https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/is-agile-waterfall-hybrid-right-for-your-team) and distributed these objectives more evenly in each sprint.
