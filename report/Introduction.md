<span style="color:purple">1.1) Abstract</span>

Fakebook - the nonsense social media feed - is a novel way of engaging people with facts about social media, and the impact it has on society. The site will use social media’s tricks against them - both pointing out the destructive influence of social media, and encouraging self-awareness about the way those tricks are used.

The site will mainly be targeting young people (aged 18 - 25) who are very reliant on social media without necessarily knowing its negative impacts - both on a personal and societal level. 

The site’s concept is that it will provide an infinite feed of randomly generated posts - simulating the seemingly endless scroll of information that we engage with every day. The playful aspect will simulate the ‘reward’ element of social media and draw attention to the random or superficial nature of a lot of the content we consume. In amongst the nonsense posts we will include some informative facts about the positive and negative aspects of social media, so as to educate visitors to the site. All of this serves to make a point about how much time we waste on social media & how addictive it is. We may also learn something about our relationship with social media: will we still find it compelling if we are interacting with artificial people rather than our friends?

# 1.2) Project Objectives

Our main project objectives are as follows:  

**Explore social media addiction, and how this affects our users’ in their daily lives:**
- Collect secondary research in the form of background research and a literature review into the areas of social media, human-computer interaction, and user experience.
- Collect primary research in the form of a survey, which explores which design prototypes of our webpage users preferred, and how our users interact with social media.

**Create a working web page that aims to educate about social media:** 
- Build a working version of our prototype which implements our final design, and is based on our users’ feedback and their experiences. 

**Test our product on users and see where this can be improved:**
- Test our working prototype on users, and collect feedback which will shape our design going forward.
- Test our webpage manually with frameworks such as Jasmine and through the creation of a test plan. Through manually testing, we are ensuring that our webpage is easy to use. 

## Success Checklist
The success criteria of our project can be defined as:

- **Relevant: Our product will be something our users want to use.** The creation of a working prototype of our webpage that is a product of our user feedback, exploration into our users’ experiences, and secondary research into social media. 
- **Serious: Our product will educate users about social media addiction.** The prototype will allow users to leave our web page with information that will either motivate them to make changes in their own daily life, or inform others. 
- **Playful: Our product will be fun, engaging and interactive to use.** The prototype will allow users to interact with the webpage in a fun and interactive way, either by providing an entertainment factor or through making them laugh.
- **Aesthetically Pleasing: Our product will implement our designs effectively.** The prototype will execute the designs in such a way that it facilitates playful interaction and enables us to effectively impart our message to users.
