## 4.1) Stack Architecture and System Design

[![MEAN logo](report_images/mean_logo.jpeg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(solution_stack))

Our product was developed using the MEAN stack architecture:
- **MongoDB** - database
- **Express** - Node.js web framework
- **Angular** - a client-side JavaScript framework
- **Node** - JavaScript web server

This framework allows for full-stack JavaScript development, ensuring ease of data transfer between sections. In theory it would allow us to quickly and efficiently turn our designs into a working prototype. For details of the specifics of our use of each part of the stack and justifications for our decisions, please consult the respective section that follows.
