Looking at the page, how confident are you that you would be able to navigate to the 'About' page, to post on the timeline, and to see more posts from the social media 'bots'?

Looking at the page, how confident are you that you would be able to navigate back to the 'main' page?","What, if anything, would you change to make navigation more straight-forward?","In the image above you can see four different presentations of the 'fact box'. The box is designed to be clear and distinct from the rest of the timeline. Which design do you think does the best job of being distinct from the other posts and also visually appealing?","Do you think that this information could be displayed in a more appropriate way, or that it should be displayed elsewhere on the page? If so, why?","In the image above you can see two options for the way that 'comments' will displayed. If a user clicks on a post from one of the 'bots', a list of automatically generated comments will appear. Option one is a 'traditional' comment interface where comments appear below the original comment, and option two is less traditional comment interface, where comments appear below and to the right of the original comment. Which style do you prefer?","Why did you prefer the interface you chose? What do you see as the disadvantages of the other interface?","Do you think either interface would make it difficult for you to navigate away from the 'comment' page?","Do you have any more thoughts or comments on any of the images given above? Do you have any ideas about how to improve the interfaces you have seen?","Do you think it should be a priority for 'bots' to respond to real trending and viral topics? These topics will reflect what is actually trending on twitter that day.","Do you think it should be a priority for the 'bots' to respond to news articles, and possibly to be seen mimicking the spread of 'fake' news in their behaviour?","Do you think that it should be a priority for the 'bots' to be funny? A funny bot may be more likely to discuss inane topics and share nonsense opinions than to properly respond to trending topics or current events.","Do you think it should be a priority for the website to look as professional as possible and to emulate the 'seamless' experience of real social media sites?","Do you think it should be a priority for users to be able to create an 'account' on Fakebook and therefore keep a record of all of their comments and likes if they wanted to?","Do you think it should be a priority for users' comments to appear publicly? This means that if you post something to Fakebook, your comment could appear on somebody else's timeline. Your engagement could therefore come from real people as well as bots.","Do you have any more comments about the extended features? Are there any features you would like to see on the site that hasn't been mentioned?","What are your thoughts on the concept for the site as whole? What do you like, or not like?"

I really like the placement of this text box. When I first saw the page, I was curious what the two purple columns on the right and left sides were. Is ""About"" a separate page or a header to the column? I really like the idea of ""Trends For You"". If I click one of the hash tags, will I see posts related to it?","Somewhat confident","At first, thought of clicking the ""Home"" button on the left side. Then, thought of clicking the ""Message"" button. This may be personal preference but maybe a label like ""Feed"" or ""Home Feed"" or a variation? I'm used to seeing the options in the About column as a header on top of the page or as a drop down/hamburger menu on the upper left but realize as a single page application it's best to ""flow"" from one page to another. Perhaps instead of having ""Trends For You"" as a separate column, have it part of the text-box for posting? So in the text box, near the bottom by the 'Post' button, have a set of popular hashtags to include. This way, more space can be allocated to the news feed and there will only be one side panel. ","Bottom-right","I like the idea of the 'fact box' and that it's embedded into the feed. Also like that the editor for the 'fact box' shows up like a user. The difference in color makes me want to read what the post if about. ","'Traditional' interface","I think for the traditional view, it's clear which post the comments are referring to.

Personally, I stopped using social media (no FB, Instagram or Twitter) and I like that this site is a satire to it. I like that the main page is an information feed.

In your description, you say the aim is to get people to stay on the site longer. Social media also has quite an addictive quality to it, and while I think the aims of this site are beneficial, how does this play into overall ethics? If you accidentally create an addictive social media stream that feeds people information that keeps them on the site, could this be used by others to do what you're raising awareness for?"
