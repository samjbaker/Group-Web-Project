Generative nonsense social media feed.

The nonsense social media feed is a novel way of
engaging people with fact about social media and use
and the impact it has in society. The site will use
social media’s tricks against them- both pointing
out the destructive influence of social media and
encouraging self-awareness about the way those
tricks are used.

The site will be targeting young people who are very
reliant on social media without necessarily knowing
its negative impacts- both on a personal and societal level.

The site’s concept is that it will provide an infinite
feed of randomly generated posts- simulating the
seemingly ‘endless’ scroll of information that we
engage with every day. You also have the ability to
interact with internet bots who will like and comment
on your posts in real time. The gameified features
will simulate the ‘reward’ element of social media and
draw attention to the ‘random’ or superficial nature
of a lot of the content we consume. All of this serves
to make a point about how much time we waste on
social media & how addictive it is.

The technical challenges we anticipate are parsing
/ generating grammatically correct sentences for
the bot’s social media posts. We will also have to
set up an appropriate database to store all the real
and fake accounts. It’s important to make sure that
the sentences we construct are appropriate to the 
subject matter- we will need a vetting process to make
sure that none of the social media posts generated are
inappropriate or offensive. We also need to make sure
the ‘facts’ we are sharing are correct.
