The posts are entertaining at first, but lose their variety quite quickly. Although saying that, I still found myself scrolling for a while, just to see what else would come up","3","I like the colour and it definitely feels similar to facebook and Twitter. (i presume that's the point?) There were some slight visual glitches though, such as the scroll not being super smooth, which is understandable considering that this is a prototype. However some of the fonts and shapes could definitely be a bit 'cleaner', to make it seem more like the big social media sites","Yes","4","Less than 5 minutes","I think it's an interesting idea. The profile pictures being Hide the Pain Harold is a fun touch! I definitely found it more engaging than I thought I would from the description"
"2021/05/05 10:05:29 AM GMT+1","5","Sometimes the scroll gets a bit stuck, which kind of affects the overall smoothness of the site","4","Maybe having more facts? I found the ones that were on the site quite interesting though. I liked how they weren't too preachy","4","Having random pictures or memes to mix it up a bit would be cool. Also letting users customize the names that might show up in the bots' posts would be fun!","3","It looks pretty nice on the whole. It is definitely recognizably similar to social media. some of it looks a bit clunky though and there are some visual glitches too. I think it could just do with being a bit more polished","Yes","3","Less than 5 minutes","I think the concept is really cool. I can imagine it being really good with a bit more refinement! I'd be much more likely to recommend it to friends if i could customize what names the bots would talk about"
"2021/05/05 10:46:58 AM GMT+1","5","It was pretty straightforward but maybe if when you had scrolled really far down that if you then clicked 'Home' it brought you back to the top.","4","If the posts related to educating facts about social media came up more frequently. Currently the nonsense posts far outweigh the facts. However I did find the facts themselves educational and linking them to their source was great as I continued to read about the fact which further educated me. ","5","I thought it was really entertaining! Quite a few posts made me actually laugh out loud which is always a good sign...","4","I thought it looked great, it was really clear and I liked how it mimicked the style of other social media sites as it made it more relatable and therefore more funny. 
 If I was being pedantic then I  think if the user names were either under the profile photo or at least lined up with the start of the post then this would be more aesthetically pleasing. ","Yes","5","Between 5 and 15 minutes","None, I thought it was really fun!"
"2021/05/05 11:01:55 AM GMT+1","5","It's very easy to use. I would have liked the hash tags to be live.","5","I would have liked to be able to see all the Fakebook facts in one place.","5","Images and videos","3","Images and videos. It does mimic the real Facebook cleverly though.","Yes","5","Greater than 15 minutes","I think this would be a very useful tool for teaching young people about social media. However, I'm not a young person and I have found the Fakebook facts quite shocking and enlightening. I was also ridiculously pleased when my fake message instantly got over 1000 likes!"
"2021/05/05 12:37:09 PM GMT+1","4","Easy to use","4","The factbox did educate but I think you need them more frequently - shorter spacing  between fake and fact, although I understand this is a random placement. The source of the fact was good idea as well. ","4","Some of the post were good however some were nonsense - which is what I think you were trying to capture. Preferred the facts than the nonsense","4","The colouring was calming. The subtle use of different hues helped note a change ","Yes","3","Less than 5 minutes","Good idea - to bring home the addiction and fake news we are bombarded with "
